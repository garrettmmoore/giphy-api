# Giphy API Generator

## Application
Hello! This is an interactive web application that uses the GIPHY API to populate gifs of your choice. This web application is built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, jQuery, and GIPHY API.

## Access
1. The site is deployed via GitHub Pages.
    1. View the site here: https://garrettmmoore.github.io/giphy-api/

## How It Works
1. First, you will see an assortment of pre-generated buttons. Click on any of these buttons to trigger an AJAX call that will "GET" 12 gifs related to that particular button.

2. By default, the gif's will appear in a non-animated state. To change the state of the gif to animated, simply click the gif. Click the gif again to stop the animation.

3. A user can also add their own buttons. By typing a search into the search bar and clicking "Add new button", a new button will be appended to the list of pre-existing buttons. This new button will now be able to generate gifs just like the other buttons.
